C# is the most popular language to build .NET applications today. Itâ€™s part of the .NET ecosystem, which offers developers all the tools, languages and frameworks to create all types of applications including web, cloud, desktop and mobile.

 C# 10, the latest version part of the .NET 6 release. C# 12 is supported along with .NET 8.0, release.

 what is new is C#10, 11 and 12?

 ## C# The Big Picture
 One of the top programming language in the world.

 - Fallows C like approach for developing program
 - Strongly typed language, statically typed at compile type - compile type inference
 - implicit type is var
 - type safety and safe - types are inference at compile type instead of run time
 - Resilient and safe with native performance 
 - C# is object oriented language
 - `int` is C# language keyword or construct being mapped to System.Int32 in .NET base class library
 - C# is object oriented with functional feature (extended with extension methods) e.g. aggregate extension method for list of arrays
 - since 2014, C# is available as open source with cross-platform using .NET 6
 - General purpose language to develop web, mobile, desktop, IOT, cloud etc applications
 - Managed Execution in C#
 - C++ is compiled language, compiled native and needs manual management, fastest performance profile, needs multiple version needs to be generated for each platform(lack of portability), 
 - Interpreted or dynamic REPL - loose or dynamic typing, slow performance profile, permissive runtime type conversion. e.g python
 - C# is interpreted language with **Managed Execution** , strong typing, runtime type safety, garbage collection and native code performance.
 - `managed execution engine` is of hybrid type
 - edit time (C#) => compile-time intermediate language => (binary encoded .dll| .exe)=> JIT (IL to cpu understand code) => runs on CPU 
 - JIT compiled when required and cached for subsequent calls. if the method is not called then JIT compiler resources are not used to compile that code
 - JIT compiler also ensure type safety during the run time
 - Execution Engine : Common Language Runtime (CLR) - JIT Compilation, Run time safety and Garbage Collection
 - .NET6 and beyond (cross platform) and legacy  platform for windows .NET 4.8
 - All new C# Projects should target the cross platform version of .NET
 - Base Class Library - suite of library part of .net installation
 - By Learning C#, you learn the broader .NET platform
 - By Learning .NET, you can choose the best language for the task at hand.
 - C# code is compiled into IL assemblies
 - IL is JIT-compiled at runtime if/when used.
 - JITed code exhibits native performance
 - CLR ensures runtime type safety
 - BCL includes general purpose libraries and app framework functionality

### The Evolution of C#
- `The only constant is change`
- Incremental not abrupt
- opt-in not mandatory
- Non breaking, not disruptive
- Codification of common patterns and best practices that emerge in the community
- Simpler and/or faster and/or safer code
- C# 9 support top level statement with one line of code
- C#6 added string interporlatin $"args[{m}]"
- Canonical Properties => Public int X {get;set;} - auto properties added in C#3
- C#9 introduces init properties, that has the values initially set by the caller
- C#6 expression bodied member `public override string ToString()=> $"{x} - {y}"`
- Switch Expression

## C#10 Fundamentals
 - The .NET Ecosystem support developing application for desktop, web, mobile, cloud, IOT, Games and AI
 - Ecosystem also support several language(C#, F# and VB.NET) and libraries to build apps, Tools to support to build apps
 - .NET 6 - cross platform runs everywhere windows, mac and linux
 - C# 
     - popular, well maintained, commonly used for building .NET application
     - Object oriented programming language
     - Type safe language
     - Familiar for C, C++, Java and JS Developers
     - Actively maintained and backward compatible
     - build console, desktop, web application, mobile apps, services
     - you can use .NET CLI and VS code to build apps for all platforms
